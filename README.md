## Note-Taking tools:

### README.md
This is a README file where you can use markdown (a markup language for formatting text) to gather notes under headers and sub-headers, inserting `code snippets` and highlighting the information that stands out to you.

## Example 1: C# OOP in markdown

### Fields

Fields are just like variables, but tied to a **class instance**.

```cs
public class Homework {
    public bool compleated;
    public string description;
}
```

To assign value to these fields, the class needs to be instantiated. This is where the **object** part comes in.

```cs
Homework playerGold = new{};
playerGold.description = "Print the value of 200 gold to the console"
playerGold.compleated = ture;
```


#### You can make tables to track your progress:
| OOP             | Assignments    | Status                |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| Classes/Objects | P1_1 + Final   | DONE, need more notes |
| Fields          | P2_1-2 + Final | DONE                  |
| Methods         | P3_1-3 + Final | Awaiting feedback..   |
| Heap            | …              |                       |
| Inheritance     | …              |                       |
| Composition     | …              |                       |
