# StudyTechnique – Resources

These resources was compiled by Mandel Cohen, October 2024, as a compliment to the lecture on Study Technique.


## Note-Taking tools:

### MARKDOWN
This is a README file where you can use markdown (a markup language for formatting text) to gather notes under headers and sub-headers, inserting `code snippets` and highlighting the information that stands out to you. Exactly what Marc's slides are made of. Check out the syntax [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/):


## Use markdown in a README on GitHub


Example from 104-csharp-oop-basics, basically Marcs slides **but in your own words**.

### Fields

Fields are just like variables, but tied to a **class instance**.

```cs
public class Homework {
    public bool compleated;
    public string description;
}
```

To assign value to these fields, the class needs to be instantiated. This is where the **object** part comes in.

```cs
Homework playerGold = new{};
playerGold.description = "Print the value of 200 gold to the console"
playerGold.compleated = ture;
```


#### You can make tables to track your progress:
| OOP             | Assignments    | Status                |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| Classes/Objects | P1_1 + Final   | DONE, need more notes |
| Fields          | P2_1-2 + Final | DONE                  |
| Methods         | P3_1-3 + Final | Awaiting feedback..   |
| Heap            | …              |                       |
| Inheritance     | …              |                       |
| Composition     | …              |                       |

### Fill your notes with hyperlinks, to Marc’s material and other sources.

## Use markdown in an application

- I use an app called [BEAR](https://bear.app) where I use markdown to format my notes (only Mac). Equivalent options that works on all platforms are [UpNote](https://getupnote.com) or [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
- Another option is [Notation](https://www.notion.so) which is more of a workspace, rather than staring up notes you’re able to build your personal wiki and utilise a bunch of other functionalities like project planning.

A huge advantage of using an application for your notes is the **search functionality** so you easily can find and retrieve the information you seek.
